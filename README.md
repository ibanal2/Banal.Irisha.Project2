To download the files for this project, click the green Code button and click on Download ZIP. 

To run this project, you will need to download and install Unity version 2021.3.6f1 and use VRTK V4.

The following is a step-by-step instruction on how to setup and install Unity: 
* First, go to the Unity website https://unity.com/ and click the Get Started button at the top.
* Click on the Individual Tab, then click on another Get Started button. 
* Download Unity Hub for your preferred platform (Windows, Mac, or Linux) 
* Install Unity Hub and then click on the Installs in the left pane. 
* Click on the Install Editor, then click the Long-Term Support to visit the download archive. 
* Choose the LTS Release version 2021.3.6f1 and then click Unity Hub to let Unity Hub install that version.

The following is a step-by-step instruction on how to build and run the project files using Unity Hub and VRTK V4: 
* You can add this project to Unity Hub and take a look at it in Unity. 
* Grab the CoffeeScene (located in Assets/CoffeeShopStarterPack/Scenes) and drag it to your hierarchy. Delete the default scene. 
* Unity should process lighting for a bit. When you play the scene you should be able to move around with the WASD keys, use the mouse to look around. 
* You can use the 2 key and 3 key to take control of the simulated left and right hand controls respectively. If you place one of the two simulated controllers into one of the red muffins you can use the left mouse button to pick them up. The 1 key takes you back to controlling the player.

The following is a step-by-step instruction on how to build and run the project files for the Quest headset:
* Plug in a Quest headset, switch the platform to Android, turn off the CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator and turn on the CameraRigs.UnityXRPluginFramework
* You can build and run the same scene on the headset and move around with your body and interact with the real controllers using the trigger on either controller. 
* Putting your thumb on the right joystick brings up a teleporter and then pressing the joystick teleports you to that location (note that once you get into position you should not use the teleporter to move around your kiosk - everything should be accessible by walking).
* Pressing the Oculus button on the right controller will allow you to exit the application.
